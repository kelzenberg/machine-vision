## U5 (Exercise 5)

Execute the `app.py` file to start the application:  
<small>The other files are only parts of _app.py_ and are not executables.</small>

```sh
python3 ./app.py
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `ESC` quits the program
- `P` saves current trackbar settings (see below)

After the program exit the stored trackbar settings (`P`) will be displayed in the console in which the python program executed in.

**Example:**

```sh
(main) Saved trackbar config for right image 'view2':
       Matcher: SGBM
       Disparity: 128
       BlockSize: 13
       PreFilterSize: 5
       PreFilterCap: 11
       TextureThreshold: 69
       MinDisparity: 24
```

### Requirements

- Python version `v3.10.4`
- Opencv-python-rolling `v5.0.0.20221015`

  or higher.
