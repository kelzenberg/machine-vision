## U1 (Exercise 1)

- Read in the image "lena.bmp", convert the image to a gray-scale image, display it on the monitor.
- Design a callback function to analyze mouse activity within the window, with which a colored framed rectangle is drawn into the image by pressing the left mouse button, the size of which is defined by dragging the mouse and fixed when the left mouse button is released.
- This process is to be repeated as often as desired by pressing the left mouse button within the image field and terminated by pressing a key, e.g. "ESC" (end of program). A previously drawn rectangle is to be deleted before drawing a new one.
- Display the image content enclosed by the frame zoomed in another image field. The magnification factor is to be adjustable between 1 and 4 by means of a slider.
- Use another slider to display the zoomed image content with adjustable false colors, as a gray-scale image or inverted gray-scale image.
- When displaying as a gray-scale image, the zoom factor is to be written into the new image field.
